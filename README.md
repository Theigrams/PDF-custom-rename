This is a Zotero plugin that allows you to rename PDF files in your Zotero library using custom rules.

**Note**: *This plugin only works on **Zotero 7.0** and above*.

## Usage

Select one or more items in your Zotero library and right click to open the context menu. Select `Rename PDF attachments` from the menu.

Then the PDF files will be renamed according to the custom rules you set in the plugin preferences(not implemented yet).

### Default rules

This plugin will read the journal name and year from the metadata of the item and rename the PDF file as follows:

```
{short journal name}_{year}_{short title}.pdf
```

For example, the PDF file of the item below will be renamed as `TPAMI_2016_Go-ICP.pdf`.

The `short title` is read from the `Short Title` field of the item. If the `Short Title` field is empty, the plugin will use the `Title` field instead.

### Journal tags

The `short journal name` is generated by selecting the first capital letter of each word in the journal name. For example, `IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence` will be converted to `TPAMI`, while `IEEE` will be ignored.

However, `ACM Transactions on Graphics` will be converted to `TG` rather than `TOG` in current version. This is because the word `on` is ignored in the conversion.
A better method is manually adding the short name of the journal in the `Tags` of the item. 

For example, you can add `Jab/#TOG` to the `Tags` of the item, and the plugin will use `TOG` as the short name of the journal.

**Note**: the plugin will first read the `Jab/#` tag in the `Tags` as the short name. If there is no `Jab/#` tag, the plugin will automatically extract the short name from the full name of the journal.

## Future work

- [ ] Add a short cut for the renaming function.
- [ ] Preferences panel to allow users to customize the rules.
- [ ] Better way to extract the short name of the journal.
